    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="blurb">
        I love creating beautiful, responsive, and intuitive interfaces. I'm a self-taught full stack web developer, obsessive learner, and problem solver. I began coding at age 10. I haven't been able to stop since. I grew up on San Juan Island, and I currently reside in Bellevue, Washington. I'm passionate about privacy, and an avid user of VPNs, IRC and PGP.
